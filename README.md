# Dev container (vscode)

This project supports development in a container using vscode's Dev Container plugin.
Devcontainer environment is the same as the environment used in the final deployment
with minor changes required for vscode addons (eg. `git` package is installed in devcontainer).
See `ai-chatbot-dev` image in [./app/Dockerfile]

## Prerequisites
Install `vscode` with `Dev Containers` plugin.

## Run Dev Container
- Open the command palette (Crtl+Shift+P)
- Type `Reopen in Dev Container`

## Start LangGraph server within Dev Container

After the container spins up, run the following command in the terminal:

```
cd app/src
langgraph dev --host 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

It can also be run through the `Run and Debug` tab, using `LangGraph Dev` launch configuration.

Open LangGraph Studio with the following link:
https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024 

Alternatively you can use a handy script that does all of the above. 
Launch it with

```
chmod +x agent_launcher.py
./agent_launcher.py
```

## Debugger

If running in Dev Container you can use the provided launch configration `LangGraph Dev (agent_launcher.py)`
It will start the langgraph server with the debugger.

Otherwise, start the server with the following command:

```
langgraph dev --debug-port 5678 --wait-for-client --host 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

INFO:langgraph_api.cli:   - Port: 5678
```

## Troubleshooting

In case of issues with running Dev Container, inspect the log first.

See the following commands in the command palette (Crtl+Shift+P):

- Dev Containers: Show Previous Log
- Dev Containers: Show Container Log
- Dev Containers Developer: Show All Logs...
